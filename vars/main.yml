# The following rules are applied in order to determine the filtered list
# of roles to be processed for producing venvs.
#
# 1. The role name must be named 'os_*'. We only want the OpenStack
#    services to be compiled into venvs.
# 2. If repo_build_venv_selective is disabled, then all the roles
#    which pass rule 1 will have venvs built.
# 3. If the 'project_group' for the role is defined and is populated
#    then the venv will be built.
